# ISING-model

This code is simulation of ising model and will calculate average Energy and Magnetization  that chages over temprature,

 It seems that around Temprature = 2.6 there is an unstability on the system. that temprature is called critical point.
 
 The code will also figure Energy and Magntization changes over Monte Carlo step at fixed temprature.you can see graph for T=3.3

 # how to run
 you need only download the code or copy it in a file with ".py" suffix, for example ising.py and run with 
 ##### python3 ising.py
 or
 ##### python ising.py
 
 or any other way for runing usuall python codes you use.
